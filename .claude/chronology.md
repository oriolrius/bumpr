## Total Development Time: ~18 minutes

### Key Achievements
1. **Complete Go implementation** following the PowerShell reference
2. **Cross-platform support** with Linux/Windows binaries
3. **Multiple version sources** with auto-detection
4. **Full CI/CD automation** with GitHub Actions
5. **Self-hosted release** - bumpr released itself!
6. **100% test coverage** for core version logic

### Technology Stack
